# Apache Zeppelin- A Friendlier Way to Flink
### By Trevor Grant - IBM

[Original talk](http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/apache-zeppelin-a-friendlier-way-to-flink/)

This talk was done with Apaceh Zeppelin notebooks instead of slides- they can be found in notebooks/

**NOTE** They will most likely not run when imported- there were serveral interpreters I was using to back the various notebooks. 
A will post a script soon for recreating the environment on IBM Big Insights Cloud (the platform I used). 

Interpreters can be easily created on your own, you just need to load the specific libraries for each interpreter. 

For example- the Apache Flink- Gelly notebooks require the [Flink Gelly](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.flink/flink-gelly_2.10/1.1.2) and [Flink-Gelly-Scala](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.flink/flink-gelly-scala_2.10) jars.
